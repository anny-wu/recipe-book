It makes a very yummy soup that will last a couple days. This really makes the extra cost of a pasture raised bird worth it! While the soup (above) is cooking, we will take the remaining bones and put them back into the crockpot, cover completely with water and follow the bone broth recipe in the “Soups and Sauces” section of this cookbook! Simple, easy and healthy way to get the most out of a single bird!",
